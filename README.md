# lip_net_basic

This repository contains the implementation of LipNet architecture on one of the parts of the dataset. LipNet is an archtitecture proposed to read the LIPs from a video and translate that information into words.

The architecture consists of Conv and LSTM Layers. Its a CNN-RNN architecture. 

Here you can find the checkpoint file for the model that has been trained for quite some time as training it takes a huge amount of time.

The dataset can be found on internet when searched for LIPNET.
